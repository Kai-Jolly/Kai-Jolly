# About Me
## Who I am
I'm a college student in the UK working towards my computer science, maths, further maths and physics A-levels. This year I will be applying to study computer science at number of universities and I hope to go to Cambridge.

## My technical skills
- **Python** - I studied this at GCSE and have completed a number of personal projects in it, including the Advent of Code 2024
- **Java** - I have studied this for a term, I have used Greenfoot, experimented with a simple project using Swing and am working on a small game using the libGDX library.
- **C** - I studied this for a term
- **HTML/CSS** - I have used this to make some simple websites

## Current projects
My current project is a binary sudoku (aka Takuzu aka Binairo) game for the Numworks calculator. I'm also making a small ray-cast game in Java to help me learn the libGDX library.
